# XBUS 505: Data Analysis II: Machine Learning

**An Introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn**

[![Scikit-Learn Cheat Sheet](docs/img/cheat_sheet.png)](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/)

## Getting Started

Please install the dependencies for this repository using `pip` or `conda` as follows:

```
$ pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

or

```
$ conda install -f requirements.txt
```

Note that you may want to install these requirements in a virtualenv or conda environment in order to make dependency management simpler.

After you've installed the dependencies, simply open a Jupyter notebook:

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

## Organization

If you're here from a cohort before Spring 2020, please refer to the `archive` folder to find any notebooks that may have been demonstrated during your courses.

The `demos` folder contains live code exercises by date. If you're looking for code that was written during class, look for the course date in this folder.

The `examples` folder contains work submitted by students engaged in the UCI machine learning repository. Please feel free to submit a PR with your work in this folder!

The `notebooks` folder has some example notebooks to refer to when working on the UCI machine learning lab or working with scikit-learn. In particular:

- **estimators.ipynb** - a tour of Scikit-Learn from the perspective of the API
- **wheat.ipynb** - an example classification notebook
