    "Special project for the Certificate of Data Science at Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies, Cohort 11\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: To predict whether someone is likely to misuse drugs based on personality factors and their use of legal substances such as caffeine and alcohol\n",

    "Methodology: This Jupyter Notebook ingests data from the UCI ML dataset repository, evaluates the data in hand, wrangles it to suit the project and to fit Scikit-Learn classification models, tests three different algorithms with some visualization of the results, and chooses the model that seems to give the best results.\n",

    "### Training Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The training dataset comes from a 2015 UK study examining the relationship between demographic and personality factors, such as age when dropping out of school, extraversion and impulsivity, and use of recreational drugs, legal or illegal. The study dataset includes 1885 instances and 32 features.\n",
